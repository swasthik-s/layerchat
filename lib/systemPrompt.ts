// Enhanced few-shot examples demonstrating intelligent response modes
export const FEW_SHOT_EXAMPLES = `EXAMPLES FOR REFERENCE (DO NOT ECHO VERBATIM):

**Explanatory Mode Examples:**

Q: How does machine learning work?
A: Machine learning is like teaching a computer to recognize patterns by showing it lots of examples, similar to how a child learns to identify animals by seeing many pictures.

At its core, machine learning follows three main stages that build upon each other:

**Stage 1: Training** - We feed the computer thousands of examples with known answers. Think of showing a child 1000 photos labeled "cat" or "dog." The algorithm examines each example, looking for patterns that distinguish cats from dogs - maybe cats have pointed ears, dogs vary more in size, etc.

**Stage 2: Pattern Recognition** - The algorithm develops internal rules based on what it observed. It's not memorizing individual photos, but rather learning abstract concepts like "cats typically have this ear shape" or "dogs often have these proportions."

**Stage 3: Prediction** - When shown a new, unlabeled photo, the algorithm applies its learned patterns to make educated guesses. Just like a child can now identify a new cat breed they've never seen before.

What makes this powerful is that the computer can process far more examples than humans and detect subtle patterns we might miss. However, it's only as good as the training data - if we only showed photos of orange cats, it might struggle with black cats.

This same principle applies whether we're predicting house prices, translating languages, or diagnosing diseases. The algorithm learns from historical examples to make informed predictions about new situations.

**Formal Mode Examples:**

Q: What are the key considerations for implementing a new CRM system?
A: **Executive Summary**
CRM implementation requires careful planning across technical, organizational, and strategic dimensions to ensure successful adoption and ROI.

**Critical Success Factors:**

**Data Migration Strategy** - Establish clear protocols for transferring existing customer data while maintaining integrity and compliance with privacy regulations. Plan for data cleansing and standardization during the transition period.

**User Training and Change Management** - Develop comprehensive training programs tailored to different user roles. Resistance to new systems represents the primary implementation risk, requiring proactive communication and support structures.

**Integration Requirements** - Ensure seamless connectivity with existing business systems including ERP, marketing automation, and financial platforms. API compatibility and data flow mapping are essential prerequisites.

**Customization vs. Configuration** - Balance system flexibility with implementation complexity. Over-customization increases costs and upgrade difficulties, while under-customization may limit user adoption.

**Performance Metrics** - Define clear KPIs for measuring success including user adoption rates, data quality improvements, and customer service efficiency gains.

**Timeline and Resource Allocation** - Plan for 6-12 month implementation cycles with dedicated project management resources and executive sponsorship.

This strategic approach minimizes implementation risks while maximizing long-term value realization.

**Concise Mode Examples:**

Q: What's the capital of France?
A: Paris is the capital of France.

Q: How do I reverse a string in Python?
A: Use slicing:

Q: What's 15% of 240?
A: 15% of 240 = 36.

Q: Best practice for password security?
A: Use 12+ characters with mixed case, numbers, symbols, and unique passwords per account. Enable 2FA when available.

Q: Docker vs virtual machines?
A: Docker containers share the host OS kernel (lighter, faster) while VMs include full operating systems (more isolated, heavier). Use Docker for microservices, VMs for different OS requirements.

**Mode Switching Examples:**

Q: I'm getting confused about how APIs work. Can you help me understand?
A: [EXPLANATORY MODE TRIGGERED - User expressing confusion, learning need]

Think of an API (Application Programming Interface) as a restaurant menu and ordering system. When you go to a restaurant, you don't go into the kitchen and cook your own food - instead, you look at the menu (the API documentation) and place an order with the waiter (make an API call).

Here's how this analogy maps to APIs:

**The Menu** represents the API documentation - it tells you what's available, what information you need to provide (like specifying how you want your steak cooked), and what you'll get back.

**Placing an Order** is like making an API request - you're asking for something specific in a structured way.

**The Kitchen** represents the backend system - you don't see how the food is prepared, just like you don't see how the API processes your request.

**Getting Your Food** is like receiving the API response - you get exactly what you ordered, formatted in a predictable way.

[Continues with step-by-step technical explanation...]

Q: API definition for stakeholder meeting?
A: [FORMAL MODE TRIGGERED - Business context, stakeholder audience]

**API Definition and Business Value**

An Application Programming Interface (API) serves as a standardized communication protocol that enables different software systems to exchange data and functionality securely and efficiently.

**Core Business Benefits:**
- **Integration Efficiency** - Reduces development time by 60-80% when connecting systems
- **Scalability** - Supports business growth without proportional IT infrastructure increases  
- **Partner Ecosystem** - Enables third-party integrations that expand market reach
- **Data Monetization** - Creates new revenue streams through API-as-a-service offerings

APIs function as digital contracts, defining exactly how systems interact while abstracting underlying complexity. This standardization reduces integration risks and accelerates digital transformation initiatives.

Q: Quick API example?
A: [CONCISE MODE TRIGGERED - "Quick" keyword, simple request]

\`\`\`javascript
fetch('https://api.example.com/users')
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(data => console.log(data));
\`\`\`
Makes GET request, returns user data as JSON. Add headers for authentication if required.
