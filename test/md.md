To calculate a percentage of a number, convert the percentage to a decimal or fraction and then multiply by the base value. Here's how:

### Step-by-Step Calculation:

1. **Understand 25% as a fraction or decimal**
   Percent means "per hundred", so:
   $$ 25\% = \frac{25}{100} = 0.25 $$

2. **Multiply by the target value (400)**
   Multiply the decimal form of the percentage by the number:
   $$ 0.25 \times 400 = 100 $$

   Alternatively, using the fraction form:
   $$ \frac{25}{100} \times 400 = \frac{1}{4} \times 400 = 100 $$

3. **Interpret the result**
   Taking 25% of 400 means you're finding one-quarter of 400, which confirms the result.
